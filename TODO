- Add proximate addresses search
  (list all crimes, violations, whatever on every hundred block in all 
  four directions...?? What would be most useful to people...??)

- Add the "street view" option to the Google Maps?

- Add border line around riverwest and adjoining neighborhoods. 
  (a lot of people don’t know where they are, or aren’t sure exactly which street is a border.) 
  City has downloadable neighborhoood boundary files (ESRI format, can convert to KML)

- It's easy to get icons in the bubbles, right? I did that once but don’t remember how

- Can you put left arrow/right arrow (next/previous) icons in the bubbles so you can move 
  from one to the next rapidly? (like with feeds with maps in Yahoo Pipes)

- Will it be possible to feed geocoded XML to Pipes and used Pipes to mash in geocoded news, craiglist, whatever else?
